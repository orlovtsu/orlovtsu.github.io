                            <h3>Introduction</h3>
							This study aims to shed light on various aspects of traffic incidents in Calgary, with a specific emphasis on understanding the frequency and patterns of incidents based on different neighborhoods, time of day, and the safety concerns for pedestrians and cyclists.
							<br /><br />
							Calgary, as a bustling urban center, experiences its fair share of traffic incidents, impacting the lives of its residents and visitors. 
							<br /><br />
							One of the key guiding questions explored in the project is how the frequency of incidents differs based on the neighborhoods of Calgary. By mapping and analyzing incident data geographically, the main project aim is to identify areas that may have a higher incidence of traffic-related incidents. Understanding these neighborhood-specific variations will enable us to pinpoint areas that require targeted interventions and proactive measures to enhance safety and reduce the occurrence of incidents.
							<br /><br />
							Another crucial aspect investigated is how the frequency of traffic incidents in Calgary changes based on the time of day. Traffic patterns and congestion levels can vary significantly throughout the day, and understanding how incidents are influenced by these temporal factors is essential for effective traffic management. By analyzing incident data across different time intervals, it can be identified peak incident hours, assess the impact of rush hour congestion, and develop strategies to alleviate these issues during specific time periods.
							<br /><br />
							In addition to neighborhood and temporal analysis, the project focuses on identifying the most dangerous areas for pedestrians and cyclists in Calgary. Pedestrians and cyclists are vulnerable road users who require special attention and protection. By examining incident data involving pedestrians and cyclists, the aim is to identify high-risk areas where these road users face increased dangers. This knowledge will aid in implementing targeted safety measures, improving infrastructure, and designing initiatives to promote safer conditions for pedestrians and cyclists in Calgary.
							<br /><br />
							Through this data-driven approach and advanced analytical techniques, the aim is to provide evidence-based insights and actionable recommendations for traffic management authorities, urban planners, and policymakers. By answering the guiding questions mentioned above, it can be contributed to the development of effective strategies to enhance traffic safety, optimize resource allocation, and create a more pedestrian and cyclist-friendly city.
							<br /><br />

							<h3>Dataset</h3>
							The dataset used for the <a href = "https://data.calgary.ca/Transportation-Transit/Traffic-Incidents/35ra-9556">Calgary Traffic Incidents</a> analysis in this project is obtained from the City of Calgary's official data portal, <a href = "https://data.calgary.ca">data.calgary.ca</a>. This dataset is a comprehensive archive of traffic incidents within the city, regularly updated every 10 minutes to ensure the most current information is available. It covers a substantial time span, starting from December 6, 2016, up to the present day.
							<br /><br />
							It's important to note that the dataset may have occasional gaps due to system or script malfunctions, which can result in missing or incomplete incident records. However, every effort is made to maintain the accuracy and completeness of the data.
							<br /><br />
							The dataset provides essential information about each traffic incident, including a description of the incident itself, geolocation, and address details. This information enables precise identification and mapping of incident locations. Additionally, the dataset includes the quadrant of the city where each incident occurred, allowing for further analysis and exploration of incident patterns specific to different areas within Calgary.
							<br /><br />
							Another crucial component of the dataset is the time of each incident, providing insights into when incidents occur throughout the day. This temporal information allows for analyzing the frequency and distribution of incidents based on different time intervals, enabling the identification of peak incident hours and temporal trends.
							<br /><br />
							The dataset is made available under the <a href = "https://data.calgary.ca/stories/s/Open-Calgary-Terms-of-Use/u45n-7awa" >Open Government License - City of Calgary</a>, which encourages the free use, distribution, and modification of the data while maintaining acknowledgment of the City of Calgary as the original source.
							<br /><br />
							It's worth noting that for more detailed information and context regarding the traffic incidents, users can refer to the Calgary Traffic Report page, which provides additional insights, updates, and relevant information related to traffic incidents in the city.
							<br /><br />
							By leveraging this comprehensive and regularly updated dataset, our project aims to extract meaningful insights, identify trends, and develop strategies to enhance traffic management, improve road safety, and optimize transportation systems in Calgary.

							<h3>Methodology</h3>
							<h4>1. Data Cleaning & Wrangling</h4>
							The data cleaning step in this project involves preparing the initial dataset obtained from the City of Calgary's data portal for analysis by addressing missing or incomplete information and identifying potential issues with the dataset.
							<br /><br />
							The initial dataset contains 39,586 rows of data. However, approximately 35.4% of these rows do not have quadrant data, which is a crucial attribute for analyzing incident patterns across different areas of Calgary. Despite this missing information, it is observed that most of the incident descriptions contain indirect indications of the quadrant in which they occurred. This valuable information allows us to fill the gaps in the quadrant data and retain these rows for analysis, ensuring that important incident data is not lost.
							<br /><br />

							<img src="images/ct1_df_after.png" alt=""  height = 300/>
							<br/> <br/>
							Further investigation reveals that the gaps in quadrant data and the MODIFIED_DT column exist from March 2019 until October 2021. Notably, during the period from June 14, 2019, to September 15, 2019, there is only one row of data available. This fact suggests the possibility of data entry rule changes during that period or a potential incident that led to the loss of data. It is essential to keep this information in mind during the analysis of the results to ensure accurate interpretation and avoid any potential biases introduced by these gaps.
							<br /><br />
							Additionally, the initial dataset includes a column named DESCRIPTION, which provides valuable insights into the types of incidents that occur in different locations. Parsing and analyzing this column can provide a better understanding of the specific types of incidents that take place across various areas of Calgary, enabling a more comprehensive analysis of the dataset.
							<br /><br />

							<br /><br />
							By addressing missing quadrant data, noting the gaps in the MODIFIED_DT column, and leveraging the information in the DESCRIPTION column, the data cleaning step ensures that the dataset is prepared for subsequent analysis, enabling accurate and meaningful insights into the Calgary Traffic Incidents data.
							<br /><br />
							<h4>2. Incident Data and Geo-spatial Data Merging</h4>
							To gain a better understanding of the incident distribution across different neighborhoods in Calgary, an additional step was taken in the data processing pipeline. Since the initial dataset did not include the neighborhood information for each incident, the dataset was merged with the geo-spatial data of community boundaries from the City of Calgary's open data portal.
							<br /><br />
							The merging process involved using the latitude and longitude coordinates provided in the initial dataset to connect each incident with its corresponding neighborhood. This was achieved by utilizing the <a href = "https://geopandas.org/en/stable/docs/reference/api/geopandas.sjoin.html">sjoin</a> function from the <a href = "https://geopandas.org/en/stable/">geopandas</a> library, which performs a spatial join based on the geometry of each community boundary.
							<br /><br />
							By merging the incident data with the community boundary data, each incident was assigned to the specific neighborhood in which it occurred. This integration allowed for a comprehensive analysis of the incident distribution across different neighborhoods within Calgary.
							<br /><br />
							Following the merging process, the data was grouped by the neighborhood name and incident type. This grouping facilitated the aggregation of incidents, providing a count of each incident type within each neighborhood. As a result, a dataframe was obtained, containing the names of neighborhoods and the corresponding counts of each incident type.
							<br /><br />
							This enriched dataframe with neighborhood information and incident counts enables a more detailed exploration of which communities in Calgary experience a higher frequency of incidents. This information can be valuable for understanding the safety concerns and traffic patterns specific to each neighborhood, aiding in targeted interventions and resource allocation to improve traffic management and enhance safety measures.
							<br /><br />
							By leveraging the power of geospatial data and integrating it with the initial incident dataset, this step in the data processing pipeline contributes to a more comprehensive analysis of the incident distribution across neighborhoods in Calgary.
