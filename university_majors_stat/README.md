## Introduction

A major is the focus of your degree program, representing a specific subject area in which you choose to specialize. Some examples of the most popular majors in Canada include business, engineering, and health. Depending on the university, students may select their major at the beginning or after
a year of study. The choice of major is influenced by various factors, such as personal interests, future career aspirations, salary expectations, and the desired industry of employment.

Choosing a major can be frustrating! Currently, more students attend university than ever. However, existing data suggest that many of them start university being uncertain about what major fits them. Many students might get discouraged and end up dropping out or having poor mental health. Therefore, having a good understanding of the different options and possibilities can help students make informed decisions about their majors, aligning their passions with their career goals. In this project, we aim to explore the popularity of different majors and the associated salary and unemployment rates. Our dataset was collected by FiveThirtyEight and represents the population of university students, including both males and females. By analyzing this data, we hope to help students to better understand the differences of majors in terms of unemployment rate, salary, and gender. Therefore, we aim to help students choose a major that aligns with their interests, career objectives, and desired salary

## Guiding questions

1. Is there a relationship between major categories and the unemployment rate?

2. What is the relationship between salary and different major categories?

3. Is there a relationship between female proportion in each major category and median salary?

## Dataset:
For our project we use data from the dataset “College Majors and their Graduates” collected from Kaggle “College Majors and their Graduates”.
This dataset contains a comprehensive selection of lavish data and processing scripts behind the articles, graphics, and interactive experiences generated by FiveThirtyEight. 
We have done a number of functions on the dataset such as Checking for NAs,Checking for Duplicates,Ensuring that the  entire dataset has consistent Formatting.

## Results

**Hypothesis** <br \>
To make a conclusion about the difference of unemployment rate between different majors the next hypothesis is done: <br />
$H_0$: There is no significant difference between in the unemployment rate between major categories<br />
$H_A$: There is significant difference between in the unemployment rate between major categories<br />
