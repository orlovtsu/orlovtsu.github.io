## Introduction

Major is a specific area of study in which a student chooses to specialize. Popular disciplines for college majors include business, health, engineering and biology. The importance of your major depends on the industry you want to work in. When students start college, it can be difficult for students to find their focus, not everybody is certain about what they want to major in. 

However, most students know they want a good-paying and secure job. This is why they are willing to make the investment of time and money to go to college.
A degree can open up unexpected And exciting opportunities and pathways that are more attractive, having perks such as a better work environment, retirement health insurance, paid time off, bonuses, stock options, wellness and benefits, continuing education as well as other memberships. There’s no doubt choosing a major is a big decision and one that many students agonize over.

You might be wondering, why is choosing major important anyway?. Don't plenty of students go in undecided or switch their initial majors and still figure it out?. It’s a sad fact that even though more students are going to college than ever, many of them are not making  it across the finish line and earn their bachelor's degree.

Here are the 3 most common reasons why students dropout, fail out or transferred out of college.
   1. They get discouraged after flipping repeatedly from major to major.

   2. They take classes that don't fit their unique aptitudes, skill sets and strengths.
   3. They feel overwhelmed by the combination of taking coursers, adjusting to the college life, choosing college major depending on the employment rate, the unemployment rate, the popularity of the major etc.

Our mission is to help school students find their passion and choose majors, make the task of getting information about college degrees easy. Choosing right major’s according to a person’s skill and knowledge will help make the society a better place to live.

## Guiding questions

Our guiding questions are based on the questions a student will get when they are choosing a major for their college degree. Even high school students are feeling overwhelmed while thinking about what major they are going to choose. 

Many are also very uncertain about whether what they have chosen has a scope to shine in near future? To bring solutions to all these questions that rises in a student’s mind we have formed a set of guiding questions which we will find answer with the help of python graph plotting’s.

  1. How does Employee’s Salary is distributed depending on their university major?

  2. What major should be chosen to find a job and maximise a salary in the future?

  3. Distribution of men and women salaries and opportunities to find jobs depending on their majors?

## Information on DataSet:
For our project we use data from the dataset “College Majors and their Graduates” collected from Kaggle “College Majors and their Graduates”.
This dataset contains a comprehensive selection of lavish data and processing scripts behind the articles, graphics, and interactive experiences generated by FiveThirtyEight. 
We have done a number of functions on the dataset such as Checking for NAs,Checking for Duplicates,Ensuring that the  entire dataset has consistent Formatting.

### License:
All this data is under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License and MIT License. The last update of the dataset was in November of 2022. 

## Results

### 1. The Distribution of majors by category:
![Distribution of majors by category](/university_majors/images/fig0.png)

The total number of majors displayed in dataset is 172 grouped into 16 groups, but, as we can see, the distribution between the engineering, scientific or humanitarian majors is not uniform.

### 2. There is interesting question to understand what is employment rate by major and salary distribution by majors?

Unemployment rate by major category:
![Unemployment rate by major category](/university_majors/images/fig1.png)

Median salary by major category:
![Median salary by major category](/university_majors/images/fig2.png)

The entire dataset contains data for all ages graduates, but for young people it is more useful information about recent data.
We can compare all ages data with data for recent graduates and see some differences between unemployment rate and salary

Unemployment rate by major category for recent graduates:

Median salary by major category for recent graduates:

### 3. Male and female distributions differences by major

One of the useful distributions might be the male and female most preferred majors distributions. We can gather these data from our dataset for recent graduates.

Men and Women proportion by major category:

Median salary to women proportion rate:

Top 20 highest salary majors with women proportion > 50%:

## Conclusion

As for the conclusion, we can say that our data analysis will be the great help to students of all age, mainly high school students who are in main need of informations on majors and its categories in college.

With the help of our analysis, the task of getting information about college major's an its scope are made easy.

We have analysed the dataset of USA, from which we have plotted our graphs and interpretted that most of the major's that fall under STEM(Science,Technology,Engineering and Mathematics) have higher chance of getting more salary and also has lowest unemployment rate.

As scope and importance of all major's in education are same across all over the world, we can strongly say that this data will be helpfull to students all over the world.

Choosing right majors according to a student's skill and interest will help increase their quality of life and happiness.

      "Happy people will produce healthy society with strong economy and higher living standard"
