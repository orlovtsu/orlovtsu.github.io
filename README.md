# Sergey Orlov Data Science porfolio

Hello everyone! Wellcome to my porfolio. I am going to explain interesting projects which I do as Data Scientist.
Previously, I have got an experience in many different fields from scientific programming to product management, and now I dive deep into the Data Science and happy to invite you to this fascinating world with me. 

## [Project 1: "STUDENTS AND CHOOSING MAJORS"]()

The first project I want to explain is the study project which was done for the course "Working with Data and Visualiation" during my Master of Data Science and Analytics program at the University of Calgary. This project was made in group of two, the link to my classmate is made in the full report. I spent a lot of my life time working at the university and found that many students does not understand how to make choise for their study major. But, in my oppinion, the major choise is criticaly important for the young human future and can easily make future specialist happy or unhappy. This is why we decided to study distribution of majors, features and future opportunities for students. 

For our project we use data from the dataset “College Majors and their Graduates” collected from Kaggle “College Majors and their Graduates”. This dataset contains a comprehensive selection of lavish data and processing scripts behind the articles, graphics, and interactive experiences generated by FiveThirtyEight.

This project is focused on visualization tasks

What was done:
- the distribution of majors by category was described using piechart from plotly 
- the distribution of graduate salaries and unemployment rate depending on major category, gender was investigated using boxplots with describing 20th and 75th percentiles, medians and variance distributions.
- the categories with top 20 salaries and least unemployment rates were found using the scatterplot visualizations with plotly and matplotlib
